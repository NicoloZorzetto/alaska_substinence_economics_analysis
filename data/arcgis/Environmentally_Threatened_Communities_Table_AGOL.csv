The community has a history of significant flooding of the Yukon and Porcupine Rivers which inundates most of the community. According to the USACE Floodplain Mapping and Data website, flooding in Fort Yukon occurs in mid-May during the breakup of the Yukon and Porcupine Rivers and is caused mainly by ice jams. The most damaging flood on record for Fort Yukon took place 1949 as a result of ice jams on the Porcupine River which resulted in 7-foot deep floodwaters in the community.  In May 2015, a State Disaster Declaration was issued by then-Governor Walker for severe flooding at Fort Yukon which damaged roads and community infrastructure. In 2013, Fort Yukon was part of a Federal Disaster Declaration for spring floods that caused extensive damage to a communities along the Yukon River. ",Prioritized 2018,No

Riverine erosion
Permafrost degradation","Due to Bethel�s location on the largest oxbow curve in the Kuskokwim River, the community is highly susceptible to riverine erosion.  The US Army Corps of Engineers built a seawall which has stabilized the Kuskokwim banks along the community and protects city dock and harbor infrastructure, residential and commercial buildings and the public road and utility poles nearby.  
Bethel experiences flooding nearly annually, inundating 80 % of the community�s residential and commercial areas.    The USACE has determined that most of Bethel is within the Special Flood Hazard Area, areas where the ground elevation is below 17.1 feet mean lower low water. Areas such as Brown�s Slough are the most flood prone and contain a high density of the residential development.  During breakup, flooding is caused by ice jams, however in late summer and early fall, heavy rains can also flood Bethel.  Poor drainage, frozen ground, permafrost, and low relief contribute to the flooding problems.  
The interaction of flooding and erosion have impacted community infrastructure in several events in 1985, 1990, 1995.  The impacts of degrading permafrost in Bethel include surface subsidence, impacting roads , buildings and residences, resulting in costly projects to repair damage.",Yes,Yes

McGrath�s location on the inside of an oxbow on the Kuskokwim River makes the village vulnerable to ice jams and stream overflow flooding from the Kuskokwim River. Flooding is a regular occurrence in McGrath; there has been significant flood events nearly every decade since the 1920s, with the most damaging event taking place in 1991 when 65 structures were inundated, and a State Disaster was declared with Preliminary Damage Assessments of more than $2 million for Individual Assistance and $7.4 million in total Public Assistance for damage to buildings and equipment.  McGrath was included in Federally-Declared Disasters in  2002 (DR-1423), 2005 (AK-05-213), and 2009 (DR-1843). McGrath is also threatened by erosion, which is occurring all along the Kuskokwim riverbank. During spring break-up, the thawed riverbank is especially vulnerable to erosion.

Sea ice loss","Diomede is subject to severe weather, erosion, flooding, however a reduction in Bering Sea ice has most significantly impacted the community�s well-being and safety. One of the most remote communities in the United States, Diomede is located on the west coast of Little Diomede Island in the middle of the Bering Strait. The village has relied on shore-fast sea ice in the winter to provide a landing strip for planes transporting residents and delivering medicine and essential supplies. For generations, local hunters have relied upon sea ice to provide access to walrus, a main staple for Diomede families who depend largely on subsistence food from the ocean to survive. Recent changes in sea ice extent and weather patterns have severely decreased access to walrus and other subsistence resources, and limited air travel to helicopter service. A reduction in sea ice has made the village increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events.   Cyclonic and anti-cyclonic storms frequently create damaging ocean swells that batter the village.  These events have damaged local utility and power plants resulting in loss of power to homes, the school, and the store.

Considerable coastline erosion in the community occurred during recent storms in 2003, 2004, and 2005.   

Most of the Shaktoolik community and surrounding area lie within the 100-year floodplain. The village is extremely vulnerable to coastal sea storms. Erosion during flooding damaged the village airstrip so extensively it was replaced. In October 2011, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a coastal flooding analysis of Shaktoolik.

Permafrost degradation","Newtok is threatened by erosion, flooding, severe weather and subsidence due to permafrost degradation. Impacted by severe erosion since the 1980s, Newtok was advised that relocation would be more feasible than protecting-in-place over the long-term.  The community made the decision to relocate in the early 1990s and in 2003, after a lengthy negotiation process, Newtok Native Corporation completed a land exchange  with the federal government for land on the north side of Nelson Island known as Mertarvik.  The community has actively pursued relocation to Mertarvik since 2006.  In October 2109, approximately one-third of Newtok�s current population will move permanently to Mertarvik, a major milestone in the village relocation effort.

Severe erosion has set in motion a range of adverse impacts to the community�s safety and well-being.  Loss of the land buffer separating Newtok and the Ninglick River has made the village extremely vulnerable to storms moving in to the Ninglick River from the Bering Sea.  Flooding and storm surges have become much more frequent in recent years.  Erosion has claimed critical infrastructure such as Newtok�s barge landing, boat docks and solid waste site.  Sediment from the eroding Ninglick River has infilled the one remaining point of water access to the community, subverting barge access  and impeding delivery of critical supplies, fuel and food. Newtok residents, particularly the very young and elderly, are experiencing significant public health problems because there is no proper way to handle human or solid waste.

Because the shoreline continues to recede, the community has moved houses and other structures back from the edge but has less and less space to do so.  According to the local hazard mitigation plan, �the effects of climate change are expected to add to natural hazards including flooding in coastal areas. As sea level rises and the offshore ice pack retreats, more coastal flooding can be expected.� 

The community has experienced a number of severe coastal storms over the past 20 years that eroded the island to such an extent that the viability of the community is at risk. In October 1997, a severe storm eroded over 30 feet of the north shore, requiring 14 homes and the National Guard Armory to be relocated. Five additional homes were relocated in 2002. Other storms have continued to erode the shoreline an average of three to five feet per year on the north shore.",No,Yes

Permafrost degradation","Chefornak experiences severe weather, erosion, flooding and subsidence due to permafrost degradation.  Erosion poses the most significant threat to the community; however flooding and thawing permafrost contribute to the erosion threat.  Chefornak experiences coastal erosion occurring along the shoreline of the Bering Sea and riverine erosion along the Kinia River embankment. Erosion of the Kinia River poses a particular threat to homes, the barge landing/jetty, bulk fuel tank farm and the Coastal Villages Region Fund Fisheries Support Center. Flood events at Chefornak have caused numerous problems in combination with erosion and thawing permafrost hazards. The introduction of floodwaters has increased thawing of the permafrost layer, causing settlement and failure of building foundations. Floodwaters have accelerated degradation of the remaining river bank and disrupted transportation to essential parts of the community. Thawing of the permafrost layer has caused subsidence, impacting the Head Start Building and utility poles. ",Prioritized 2018,No

The community is subject to ice jams and stream overflow flooding from the Yukon River.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reported a high frequency of flooding and found Galena to be in a high flood hazard area.  The 2013 Spring Ice Jam Flood (DR4122) established a new flood of record and was the worst flood in Galena�s history.  Most of the community voluntarily evacuated to avoid serious injury.  The Old Town section was completely destroyed by flood water and ice impacts.  The New Town section was extensively damaged in similar manner.  Approximately 194 homes were seriously damaged, uninhabitable, and must be completely rebuilt. Long term recovery efforts will continue through 2016.   Galena experiences significant flooding and riverine erosion.   Erosion is occurring all along the Yukon riverbank. During break-up, the thawed riverbank is water saturated and unstable allowing the swollen river to wash it away. The Yukon River has removed most of the river bank protecting Old Town and is continuing towards New Town. ",No,Yes

A reduction in the extent of Bering Sea ice has added to Savoonga�s vulnerability because the sea ice serves as a buffer against the effects of sea storms.  Savoonga has Been impacted by a number of sever storm events.  Most recently, a Presidentially-Declared Disaster was made in 2016, when sea storm bearing hurricane-force winds damaged approximately 30 homes and a number of public facilities in Savoonga.
